        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Mattnifico's Ready or Not Commander+ app! I created this app to improve upon Ready or Not's Commander mode, which I think is a good foundation but needs a lot more fleshing out.</p>
        <h2>Starting Gear</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Primary</li>
            <li>Secondary</li>
            <li>Armor - None</li>
            <li>Gear - Only weapon magazines</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Contracts</h2>
        <p>***NOT CURRENTLY IN APP*** Before jumping into your first mission, check out the contracts page to get started securing better weapons and gear. One contract can be picked at a time, and will be obtained after a mission completion form has been submitted. Once the form has been submitted, the available contracts will update and the unlocked gear will be available for purchase in the armory.</p>
        <h2>Mission Completion Form</h2>
        <p>Once you complete a mission, fill out the mission completion form on the home page. In the textbox, simply input the letter grade received after your mission. Different grades give you different amounts of funding:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>F: $0</li>
            <li>E: $100</li>
            <li>D: $200</li>
            <li>C: $300</li>
            <li>B: $400</li>
            <li>A: $500</li>
            <li>A+: $700</li>
            <li>S: $1000</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the large map checkbox is checked, the amount of money gained from the mission is doubled. Personally, I consider the large maps to be Twisted Nerve, Greased Palms, Valley of the Dolls, Neon Tomb, and Relapse, but you can decide what maps you think are worth double funding.</p>
        <h2>Armory</h2>
        <p>Once a contract is completed, the unlocked gear will appear for sale in the armory. Currently, each purchase is a one-time unlock, allowing you to equip your weapons and gear on all soldiers in an unlimited amount. I'm working on a "hard mode" where all equipment must be purchased individually.</p>
        <h2>Inventory</h2>
        <p>The inventory page shows what weapons and gear you've unlocked so far. This is solely a reference page.</p>
        <h2>Evolving City</h2>
        <p>***NOT CURRENTLY IN APP*** Los Suenos is a turbulent and twisted place, constantly changing your SWAT team's situation. Every three missions submitted, a random event will appear, either helping or hurting your team. Some events include increasing or decreasing funding, changing the roster, or playing certain missions. A checkbox is also available to toggle this feature on or off.</p>
